# PhDThesis-Code
Archive of original Mathematica code used in my thesis - release version only


The code provided here is sufficient to generate all figures that are 
presented in my PhD thesis "Degrees of Freedom in the marginal ice 
zone's wave--ice system". This is a code archive and therefore 
neither updated nor maintained. If you are interested in my 
PolynomialChaos package, please refer to the separate project on 
GitHub: https://github.com/JEM-Mosig/PolynomialChaos
